# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-TSP-
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in combinatorial optimization.
The main idea is:
Goal: To find the shortest possible route (or path) that visits a given set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.

Inputs:
A list of cities.
The distances or costs associated with traveling between each pair of cities.

Constraints:
Each city must be visited exactly once.
The path must form a closed loop (returning to the starting city).

Objective:
Minimize the total travel distance (or cost).
